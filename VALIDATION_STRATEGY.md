# Data Validation and Sanitization Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for validating and sanitizing user-submitted data in the "Random Idea Generator" application.

## 1. Validation Rules

### `idea-input` Field

*   **Maximum Length:** 280 characters. This keeps ideas concise and manageable.
*   **Character Limits:** Allow alphanumeric characters, spaces, and common punctuation. Disallow special characters that could be used in injection attacks (e.g., `<` `>` `(` `)` `{` `}` `&` `/` `\` `'` `"`).
*   **No Empty Submissions:** The field cannot be empty or contain only whitespace.

### Future Fields

This strategy can be extended to future fields by defining a similar set of rules for each new input. For example, if a `category` field is added, validation rules might include a list of allowed categories.

## 2. Sanitization Process

To prevent XSS and other injection attacks, all user input will be sanitized before it is rendered in the application. The sanitization process will remove or encode any potentially malicious content.

### Recommended Library: DOMPurify

I recommend using **DOMPurify**, a popular and well-vetted library for HTML sanitization.

*   **Why DOMPurify?**
    *   It's specifically designed to prevent XSS.
    *   It's highly configurable and can be adapted to allow or disallow specific HTML elements and attributes.
    *   It's widely used and trusted by many large applications.

## 3. Error Handling

When a user's input fails validation, they will be shown a clear and user-friendly error message.

*   **Error Message Format:** Error messages will appear directly below the input field. They will be concise and explain what needs to be fixed.
*   **Example Messages:**
    *   "Idea cannot be empty."
    *   "Idea is too long (maximum 280 characters)."
    *   "Idea contains invalid characters."

## 4. Implementation Plan

The implementation will be done in the frontend JavaScript file.

*   **File to Modify:** `app.js`
*   **Overview of Changes:**
    1.  **Add DOMPurify:** Include the DOMPurify library in the project.
    2.  **Validation Logic:** In `app.js`, add a function to validate the `idea-input` field against the defined rules.
    3.  **Sanitization:** Use `DOMPurify.sanitize()` on the user's input before it is displayed.
    4.  **Error Display:** Implement logic to show/hide error messages based on the validation result.
